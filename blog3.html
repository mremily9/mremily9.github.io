        <h1>Design approach 2: The Pluriverse / Indigenous Futurism</h1>
        
        <h2>Indigenous futurism</h2>
        <p>An artistic movement where it shows indigenous groups of people within the future. These depictions can be done in many mediums, through art, games, novels, game etc.
            <br>Allowing for representations of their people and culture, moving from the western, often American/European point of view. This representation needs to be made to allow for the general public to see these people in the present and future - so that. this isn't a foreign thing to imagine. 
            <br>Also the stereotypes created by the representation of these groups of people being linked with only the past - creating an image of them in the past and not in the current or future.
            <br>Indigenous Futurism also allows for these people to have greater empowerment on being able to change the future - if they can see themselves and their cultures pictured in the future. 
            </p>
        <h2>Speculative design critique</h2>
            <p>A critique could be made on a speculative design by how it is made with the western middle classes in mind in the future, creating a future that only seems reasonable for people that are in a place of privilege - a future that is more likely to occur/happen for these groups of people.
                <br><br>This view creates mostly futures with privileges that the middle class have, making it so that near futures are less likely to happen for the unprivileged and the underrepresented groups of people. - This, in turn, also lessens the amount of almost boring/average futures for some groups of people or even futures that even depict them and their cultures and beliefs within them. 
                <br>Examples of these divides can be seen with ideas of marriage being traditional - monogamy and heterosexual.
                <br>No power structures or clear differences between people - the rich and the poor
                <br>Often these futures don't think in with a lot of people in the current - as they aren't the topic of thought.
                </p>
        <h2>Case study</h2>
        <img src="blogs/Frame 2 (5).png">
                <p>Describe the issues it examined and the methods it used to communicate them. What was the overall goal of the design?
                    <br>This is an example of indigenous futurism, created by Taylor Mcarthur. They use many digital mediums to create their work, such as 3D modelling, animation, augmented reality and games. This allows for them to create worlds for the indigenous future by making them interactive and easily immersive places. They look at the landscapes that could be seen within a more indigenous point of view. 
                    
                    <br><br>Line of Sight
                    <br>This is an interactive environment that can be explored by the users and walked around. With the use of digital media, she is able to create a future for the indigenous by using technologies that are newer and more digital - which is where the future seems to be heading. 
                    The interactive manner of this work allows for a better understanding of what the potential future could look and feel like. Making a more interactive experience creates a better impact on the players and a better understanding of the future world. 
                    This work allows for representation of herself, from her own identity and how she is linked with the land - such as memories. 
                    
                    
                    <br><br>How does this case study extend and challenge the ideas and assumptions of Dunne and Raby's version of Critical/Speculative Design?
                    <br>This case study shows Indigenous Futurism in an artwork manner, providing a world that was created from questioning the future and its link with indigenous people. This shows speculative thinking in an artistic manner and less of a designing manner.
                    <br>This raises questions and provides a potential answer, not necessarily for society and how we could change but for what could be a future for the indigenous.
                    <br>Presenting a future through the lens/culture of indigenous
                    <br>It allows for showing and representing the potential indigenous future landscapes.
                    <br>addressing the issues of the current world - link with the past and future - how they need to celebrate and show their people more to help change the opinions of the current
                    <br>Not necessarily things that could improve society if asked, but to celebrate their culture
