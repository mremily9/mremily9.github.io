        <h1>Blog 2 | Design Methodology and Planning</h1>
        <h2>Design 302 | Date: 04/08/24 (Sunday)</h2>
        <h2>The Four Fs</h2>
        <p>Within this blog post, I’ll be reflecting on mostly week 3 based on the toolkits, using The Four Fs.</p>
        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p>During week 3, I started on the inspiration phase, looking into researching more on my topic. I continued to plan more on the design process for my project. Examining the different phases of my design process and confirming the methods and tools I would use. </p>

        <h2>Feelings</h2>
        <p>Throughout this week and previous weeks, I have felt unsure and somewhat insecure about what I am doing. Not confident or certain in how my project was going to turn out. 
            As I had gone through the IDEO toolkit and selected each method of my design process, I started to feel more confident in the inspiration and ideation phases of this project, yet uncertain if this design methodology was the right choice when I had started looking into the implementation phases. They seemed to be more business-oriented than I had thought previously, which made me feel somewhat frustrated and confused about why I had previously chosen this toolkit. 
        </p>
        <h2>Findings</h2>
        <p>I had found from doing this that despite this design toolkit being not exactly what I had previously thought, going through its phases and methods had definitely helped with my previous feelings of confusion and fuustrations on the future/process of this research. Although I had negative initial reactions to the implementation phases of this toolkit, I’ll keep using it. I also learnt that these business-oriented methods are vital in the IDEO toolkit for its three lenses - which cover design innovation as being desirable, feasible and viable.</p>
        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>From this, I have taken away that my chosen design method wasn't a perfect fit. However, I will continue using it, with the potential to change some aspects of the implementation methods to better fit my research, being less business-oriented.
            I can also take away from this the importance of planning ahead, had I not gone through my design methodology beforehand, I might've felt this frustration later in the design process and not have the time to think through what I would do. Having gone through this early on, I was able to change my plans according and if I had deemed this design methodology fully unfit, I would been able to change it before I had started on my project, saving away wasted efforts and emotions.
