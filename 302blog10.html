        <h1>Blog 8 | Rapid Prototyping within the Break</h1>
        <h2>Design 302 | Date: 17/09/24 (Tuesday)</h2>
        <p>
            This is a small reflection based on what I had done over the inter-semester break, looking into the starting phase of the ideation phase, focusing on rapid prototyping. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What?</h2>
        <p>
            I started to do some early rapid prototyping for my project, focusing on one of my concepts had created previously. The rapid prototyping I had done was looking into 3D modelling and 3D animation within Blender and testing how my idea work within AR.
