        <h2>Personal Position</h2>
        <p>
            I have grown up in Auckland for m,y whole life, making it where all my education has come from, primary, intermediate and college/high school. I have liked to create things with my hands since I was young. This included arts and crafts; I was drawing, painting, knitting and creating clay sculptures as I found joy in seeing the finished product and what I could create physically. This is seen in how I enjoyed Design and Technology as a subject in school. 
<br><br>
I come from a Chinese family, with parents who came to New Zealand when they were young, making they also used to the New Zealand/Western culture. This made it so that growing up,, I would do and partake in some traditional Chinese customs or have been told ideas and beliefs that came from the Chinese culture, such as medication, health, food and superstitions. 
<br><br>
Even though within my family I was raised more culturally Chinese, I had only visited China once and can barely speak the language, this made me growing up feel somewhat disconnected from my ethnicity, and I picked up a lot of my values and beliefs from others in school or from the western internet. Making my values and beliefs from a mixture of Chinese/East Asian and western ideals. 
<br><br>
Within the UNSDGs, I had found I had gravitated towards Goal 12 - Sustainable consumption and production patterns
I liked this goal as it is something that directly affects the environment. I also don't like the current culture surrounding the consumption of products as it does create extra waste. This could link to how I like to use what I own, save things and reuse items when I can, such as collecting plastic bags and cardboard for later uses. 
<br><br>
In terms of the Design Kawa, my values align with Kaitikitanga (care for each other and our natural environment) 
I found that I like peace and harmony within groups of people, and I also enjoy helping out others when asked and if I can, which links back to care for each other. 
I feel like the earth is directly affected by us and our actions, especially as designers that create and produce new products.

        <h2>Three domains
        </h2>
<p>I then went through my day with a partner where we looked into three domains that I could look into in the future. 
    
    <img src="blogs/image 13.png"><br><br>
    Here is a miro board consisting of the domains and brainstormed on them. <br><br>
