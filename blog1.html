        <h1>Self-discovery & scenario development</h1>
        <h2>Personal Position</h2>
        <p>Personal History<br>
            I have liked to create things with my hands ever since I was young. This included arts and crafts, I was drawing, painting, knitting and creating clay sculptures as I found joy in seeing the finished product and seeing what I could create physically. 
            Chinese family/cultural background 
            With traditional Chinese customs, however, both of my parents came to New Zealand when they were teenagers, making them used to the New Zealand/Western culture
            <br><br>Education 
            <br>I grew up in East Auckland my whole life all of my education so far was within there such as primary, intermediate and college/highschool 
            Subjects I had enjoyed
            Design and Technology, Painting, did Physics and Maths 
            Beliefs and Values
            <br><br>UNSDGs
            <br>Goal 12 - Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
            As I like something that would help care for the environment
            There is too much waste which could be used, the culture of consumption is affecting the enrvioment directly 
            I like to use what I own, save things and reuse if I am able to
            <br>Goal 8 - Decent work and economic growth
            I like feeling productive, doing things and creating things 
            However, the work environment should change for the better - mental health and child labour 
            For fulfilment in life and being able to do somehting
            <br><br>Design Kawa
            <br>Kaitikitanga - care for each other and our natural environment
            A kawa I like as it allows for caring of others, I like peace and harmony within people and things
            Envriomental element - as the earth is affected directly by us and our actions, would like to have changes to be made 
            Especially by us designers as we create the new products and our future
            Like to help others aswell, like being asked for help and giving out the help if I am able to
            </p>
        <h2>Future Diary        </h2>
        
<p>I would start of the day at around 7-8am and allow time for me to do things in the morning 
Getting ready, mentally waking up myself, reflecting, exercising etc
I feel most productive at the morning 
My mind is also more clear 
So I would like to have some work to do within around 9am -1pm
<br><br>Work 
Not the standard 9-5, 40 hrs
More of the hybrid or better commute towards a workplace
Change the hours as more rest is needed for better productivity? - change the hours
rest nap around 2-3 to allow for energy for the job - as it would allow me to be more productive
the job would be remote or in person - in a view about high above - allowing me to see buildings and the sky from above in the window
<br><br>Food
Snacks, prepackaged or prepped food
A sort of delivery system - like a meal plan
<br><br>Space 
Living within an apartment situation - like the views 
Living with others to not get lonely
Or pets
Or other ?? that could be created 
Same with the office space - individual spaces so that I don't get distracted
Ergonomic work set up 
Such as the chair, eyeline level with the monitor of the screen etc
Job would work with computers
More monitors - new shapes? 
Would like to work with new technologies 
Would want to also create something that i can see the final product
<br><br>Public transport - better
<br><br>Walkable cities so that I am walking more
<br><br>Resting
More comfortable clothing, spaces
Separate spaces for different things </p>

        <h2>Three domains
        </h2>
        <p>I then went through my day with a partner where we looked into three domains that I could look into in the future. 

            <br><br>List of domains?
            <br>Education
            Virtual, better mentally for the children - hours, more active rather than answering instructions 
            Work 
            <br>Workplace and setup 
            <br>Out inner living areas and how it will be set up 
            <br>productivity/habits
            <br>Transport 
            <br>loneness/ solitude 
            <br>Living situations and how we will live with each other? 
            <br>Could also link with socialising/talking/communication and how we will do that
