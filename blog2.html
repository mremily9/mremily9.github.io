        <h1>Design approach 1: Speculative design </h1>
        
        <h2>Speculative design</h2>
        <p>What are the key features of Speculative Design?
            <br>- A method of design that allows us to think about the future - to branch out and create questions on the potential
            <br>- A different method of design thinking from the traditional, it asks questions rather than answers
            <br>- Its based on the imagination - the limit is the designers imagination 
            <br>- because of this nature of design thinking
            <br>- this type of design allows us to think about the future and to head/create the future we would want
            <br>- it also allows us to see new tech and now tech from the current would be affecting us in the future
            <br>- can also help us in preventing a future we don’t want- a more dystopian future or help us to work towards a future we want - such as a utopia
            </p>
        <p>
            <br>How does it differ from the design frameworks you’ve encountered on the Design programme so far?
            <br>- So far, the only other design framework we have looked into is the double diamond 
            <br>- Which asks questions, but the final outcome is an answer to the problem
            <br>- this design framework begins by ideating, which asks some questions within its framework first, and then it iterations into an answer 
            <br>- making it so that the final answer of the design brief/question is an answer to the equation 
            <br>- this is a more critical type of design thinking as it analyses the question and creates an answer 
            <br><br>Speculative design 
            <br>- design thinking which asks questions, and the final outcome is a question
            <br>- Its broads out - more divergent thinking and solutions
            <br>- They allow us to think more about the future - what ‘worlds to create
            <br>- Placing the designer in the centre instead of the client/target person
            <br>- It allows us to be creative and be out there 
            <br>- it also creates worlds - rather than products
            </p>
            <h2>Beyond Speculative Design 
            </h2>
<p><br>Some strengths
    <br>- It allows for many possibilities
    <br>- Allows us to be creative in our thinking 
    <br>- It is a method that allows us to think about the future and question what we know and what we could possibly do later on to change. 
    <br>- Creating questions and creating changes with the possibilities of the designs 
    <br><br>Limitations
    <br>- It's not that practical - the output doesn't lead to much 
    <br>- It doesn't give any means 
    <br>- It creates ‘worlds’ rather than products (ideas so it could not be as concrete if they wasn't looked into in a more affirmative manner)
    <br>- criticism on how its created with a western mindset - so that the worlds imagined that are in the near future also links or can be obtained from ppl in places of privilege 
    <br>- They don't think about the other scenarios of others and only of themselves.
    <br>- The link with the pluriverse

            <h2>Future of Jobs - case study            </h2>
<p>Describe the issues it examined and the methods it used to communicate them. What was the overall goal of the design?
    <br>A research project was done by two master's students (Wongsathon Choonhavan and Daphne Gerodimou) 
    Focus on educating the future generation of the job market - goal 
    Jobs were stable but now not
    <br>- report from World Economic Forum 
    <br>- 65% of children in primary school now will be working in jobs that didn't exist now
    <br>They communicated this within 4 steps
    <br>- Changing perception
    <br>- Imagining a future job
    <br>- Role play
    <br>- Future skills
    <br><br>They did workshops with children to help them start to create their own careers that could be potentially in the future
    <br>- out of the box thinking
    <br>- Used templates 
    <br>passion map
    <br>- Helped the childrens to reflect on themselves and their skills 
    <br>One day scenario
    <br>- A guide into the future and what they would see 
    <br>Making a magic machine for your future job
    <br>- Creating, prototyping for what they could be working with in the future
    <br>Collage toy
    <br>- Was made to allow for users to do in their own time, a toy that helps with the children's creativity by creating paper collages of what their futures could be 
    <br>Instagram accounts
    <br>Gachapon
    <br>- Created job concepts and collected some from the public - Instagram 
    <br>- Inspire children about their future jobs - for ones who are scared to think about the future or who hasn't thought about it yet
    <br>- It gives a QR code to their Instagram - for more information 
    
    <br><br>Why did you find it a more successful example of speculative design than the other cases your group analysed? How did it better achieve its goal?
    <br>It was much more interactive with their methods of communication
    <br>Workshops, many templates and activities listed, allowed for more spread and awareness of the topic and helped fulfil the want or goal of getting children thinking about their future jobs - what they would want to do
    <br>In the workshops and activities,it didn't create the future or the project didn't make or present a future job and communicated it within that manner to question if children wanted these potential jobs that were given to them - however, they asked more questions and spread the imaginative and questioning nature of speculative design with the target audience 
    <br>The Instagram account does give potential ideas of future jobs - presenting their ideas of the future, and also the interactivity with social media allows for ideas to be shared on the topic of future jobs for children to be made
    <br>This allows for the children to think about how these are possibilities of jobs, to think further than a policemen or a teacher - standard jobs
