        <h1>Blog 5 | Proposal Presentation for 301 Assignment 2 </h1>
        <h2>Design 302 | Date: 22/08/24 (Thursday)</h2>
        <p>
            This blog post will look into the proposal presentations we were required to do for assignment 2 of 301, reflecting back on what had happened using the Four Fs toolkit of the cycle of active reviewing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p>
            We had an assignment due for our 301 course, which included a presentation that was to be done in person within studio time. On the day of the presentation, the technology stream had gotten a message that our stream leader had gotten sick with COVID-19. This message was done a few hours before the presentations were meant to occur. The message also included a link to a Zoom meeting for the presentations to occur online. 
            During the Zoom meeting, we took 20 mins to set up, and then only one student presented to the class. His presentation had technical issues and was hard to hear. After this presentation, a classmate suggested that we record videos instead of our presentation. Instead, we all recorded our presentation and sent it to Mairi. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Feelings</h2>
        <p>
            When we first got the message that our course leader was sick, my first feeling was concern over her health and hope that she was feeling okay. I then felt confused and somewhat more stressed about what was happening to our situation. As I had a test right after the presentations, I started to feel the stress of time and the uncertainty of the situation.  
            As we went into the Zoom meeting, I felt frustrated and constantly unsure of how the presentations were going. As we figured out another alternative, I felt relief over this. However, I had more stress back on the test I had to focus on at that moment. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Findings</h2>
        <p>
            I learned that many things can occur at unexpected times, and as such, you can't ever have any plans work out as you imagined. Things can happen to anyone, so plans will need to change to accommodate for these, such as sickness. 
            Despite the initial plans not working out (meeting up in person at the studios), our second plan (Zoom meeting) also did not work out. It was only till our final plan of recording the presentations that it worked out. 
            Despite all the confusion and emotional mess that comes with plans becoming mixed up with unexpected issues, things happen, and we will need to adapt to the situation. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>
            In the future, I will look into keeping in mind that things can change and nothing is set in place. Everyone can get sick, so when planning for things, it is important to keep in mind that things can happen and people can get sick, putting a pause on our plans. 
            That dispate things coming up, being adaptable and having back up plans can prove to be useful.
